<h2>Pirate Defense v2.0</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
    The originality from the game comes from the target movement and size changing. The cannon ball also has gravity which makes for interesting gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
    The velocity of the cannon ball was calculated using trigonometry and physics rather than using the built-in phaser functions. I made this choice because I didn’t understand the phaser examples, but I did know enough math and physics to implement it myself. The restart mechanism is also better than in my previous games. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
    I learned a lot about the phaser physics function for setting velocity and angle. The hardest part was making the cannon ball move towards the cursor. The easiest part of the game was actually the target physics because it was mostly just picking a static point and giving it a velocity
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
    I made the cannon, cannon ball, and target. The remaining resources are listed below with their proper links. <br />

<ul>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
    This was an iteration of my previous weeks game in which I learned to break scenes up into multiple files. This game doesn’t specifically follow any phaser examples and information for building  it came from previous games and the phaser API.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    Attempt to shoot targets which increase in speed and decrease in size to earn 1000 points.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
    I iterated a previous game which had the theme of pirates. This is shown by the pirate ship and cannon.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
    The target positions are randomly generated to make the player react quickly to shoot them. The genre is arcade with the main goal being to get 1000 points or a high score. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
    I wanted to test the player’s reaction time and aiming skills when attempting to shoot a moving target.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
    I want players to have a challenging but fun time trying to break enough targets to get 1000 points. It should be relaxing and easy to play. I hope they enjoy the simplicity of the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
    The controls for this game only involve clicking with the mouse to fire the cannon. The cannon can only shoot one cannon ball at a time, and the player loses a life if they miss a target or the target falls off screen (player will only be able to lose 1 life per target miss or target falling off screen not 2 lives). As the game progresses, the targets get smaller and they begin to move downwards towards the water. If the player loses 5 lives the game is over and if they have more than 1000 points they win. The game can be restarted by clicking. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
    I don’t think any particular strategy will be effective other than trying to shoot the targets as they fall. In the later stages of the game the targets move towards the center of the screen, so waiting for them to get closer might make them easier to hit.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
    You are a wannabe pirate who just found a ship that will take you. After teaching you the basics, it is now time to learn to fire the cannon. This is your chance to impress everybody and show them why you should be a member of the crew. The highest score achieved by any of the crewmates is 1460. Think you can do better? 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
    I think the demographic for this game will be people who enjoy simple arcade games in which the goal is to get as many points as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
    The game takes a few minutes to play but can take up to 10 minutes if you get into a rhythm with hitting the targets.
